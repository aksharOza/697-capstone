# 697-capstone

This repository is for the log parsing and a few of the data visualization graphs that were created for Team Home SUrveillance. This code was originally developed and tested within Django, a Python based web framework but has been extracted and placed into working Jupyter Notebooks so the readers may recreate the results. The included requirements file contains all of the libraries required for the entire web application and does not include Jupyter.
